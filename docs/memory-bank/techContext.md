# Tech Context: TemperatureChart

## 1. Frontend Framework

- **Next.js**: The project is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. This is indicated by the presence of `next.config.mjs` and the `src/app` directory structure.
- **React**: The core UI library.
- **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript for static typing, as evidenced by `tsconfig.json` and `.tsx` file extensions.

## 2. Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. The `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.mjs` files confirm its use.
- **Shadcn/UI**: The project appears to use shadcn/ui, a collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. This is suggested by the `components.json` file and the `src/components/ui` directory.

## 3. API and Data Fetching

- **Open Meteo API**: The primary source for weather data.

## 4. Development Environment

- **Node.js/npm**: The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files indicate a Node.js environment with npm for package management.
- **Git**: The project is under version control with Git.
