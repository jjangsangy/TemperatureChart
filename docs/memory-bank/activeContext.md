# Active Context: TemperatureChart

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on establishing a comprehensive and accurate Memory Bank for the TemperatureChart project. This involves creating the initial set of core documentation files that capture the project's purpose, technology stack, and architecture.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Initialized Memory Bank**: Created the `docs/memory-bank` directory and the following core files:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
- **Information Gathering**: Populated the initial Memory Bank files by analyzing the existing project structure and the `docs/blueprint.md` file.

## 3. Next Steps

- Create the `progress.md` file to complete the initial Memory Bank setup.
- Review the populated Memory Bank for accuracy and completeness.
- Await further instructions from the user.

## 4. Key Decisions & Insights

- The project is a well-structured Next.js application using modern tools like Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI.
- The `blueprint.md` file provides a solid foundation for understanding the project's core requirements.
- The Memory Bank will be the single source of truth for this project moving forward.
