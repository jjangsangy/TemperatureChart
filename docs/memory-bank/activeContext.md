# Active Context: TemperatureChart

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the temperature chart visualization by incorporating day/night indicators and maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Removed Unused AI Features**: Deleted the `src/ai` directory and removed Genkit-related dependencies from `package.json`.
- **Removed Unused UI Components**: Deleted numerous unused `shadcn/ui` components from `src/components/ui`.
- **Removed Unused Hooks**: Deleted `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx` and `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`.
- **Fixed Import Errors**: Corrected import statements in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx` after component removals.
- **Updated Memory Bank**: Updated `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the removal of AI features.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Unnecessary dependencies have been identified and removed, streamlining the project.
- **Fixed `tailwindcss-animate` reference**: Removed the `tailwindcss-animate` reference from `tailwind.config.ts` after uninstalling the package.
- **Re-added `next-themes` and `lucide-react`**: These dependencies were found to be in use and were reinstalled to resolve module not found errors.
- **User Re-added Dependencies**: The user re-added `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod`, indicating they are necessary.
- **API Enhancement**: Modified `src/lib/weather.ts` to include `daily=sunrise,sunset,temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_probability_max,daylight_duration` in the Open Meteo API call, fetching additional daily metadata.
- **New Component Added**: Created `src/components/metadata.tsx` to display daily weather metadata.
- **Chart Visualization Enhancement**: Updated `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` to use the fetched sunrise and sunset data to visually distinguish between day and night hours by dimming the bar color for night and brightening it for day. The current hour highlighting remains.
- **Data Flow Update**: Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to pass the new `sunrise`, `sunset`, and other daily metadata to the `TemperatureChart` and `Metadata` components.
- **Added Footer Component**: Created `src/components/footer.tsx` and integrated it into `src/app/page.tsx` to display a link to the GitHub repository and author acknowledgment, including the current year.
- **Dependency Added**: Installed `date-fns` for date and time formatting in the `Metadata` component.
- **Tooltip Shading**: Removed `cursor={false}` from `ChartTooltip` in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` to enable hover-activated shading on the bar chart.

## 3. Next Steps

- Await further instructions from the user.

## 4. Key Decisions & Insights

- The project is now streamlined, focusing solely on its core functionality of displaying temperature data.
- The removal of unused code improves maintainability and reduces bundle size.
- The Memory Bank has been updated to accurately reflect the current state of the project.
- It's crucial to thoroughly verify dependency usage, as simple file searches might miss indirect or framework-level usages.
- User feedback is paramount in determining necessary dependencies, especially for those not directly imported but used by the framework or other components.
- Implemented a temperature unit toggle (Fahrenheit/Celsius) with `localStorage` persistence, enhancing user experience and customization.
- The client-side conversion logic for temperature units in the chart component was removed as the API now provides the temperature in the correct unit, avoiding redundant conversions.
- The temperature unit toggle button in `src/app/page.tsx` was refined to be smaller, use "°C" / "°F" symbols, and repositioned next to the theme toggle for better aesthetics.
- **Visual Clarity**: The addition of day/night visual distinction in the chart significantly improves the readability and contextual understanding of the temperature forecast.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Enabling the tooltip cursor provides a more interactive and informative user experience when hovering over chart elements.
