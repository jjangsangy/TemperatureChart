# Active Context: TemperatureChart

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on maintaining a clean and efficient codebase for the TemperatureChart project by removing unused components and dependencies.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Removed Unused AI Features**: Deleted the `src/ai` directory and removed Genkit-related dependencies from `package.json`.
- **Removed Unused UI Components**: Deleted numerous unused `shadcn/ui` components from `src/components/ui`.
- **Removed Unused Hooks**: Deleted `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx` and `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`.
- **Fixed Import Errors**: Corrected import statements in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx` after component removals.
- **Updated Memory Bank**: Updated `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the removal of AI features.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Unnecessary dependencies have been identified and removed, streamlining the project.
- **Fixed `tailwindcss-animate` reference**: Removed the `tailwindcss-animate` reference from `tailwind.config.ts` after uninstalling the package.
- **Re-added `next-themes` and `lucide-react`**: These dependencies were found to be in use and were reinstalled to resolve module not found errors.
- **User Re-added Dependencies**: The user re-added `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod`, indicating they are necessary.

## 3. Next Steps

- Update `progress.md` to reflect the current status of the project after code cleanup.
- Await further instructions from the user.

## 4. Key Decisions & Insights

- The project is now streamlined, focusing solely on its core functionality of displaying temperature data.
- The removal of unused code improves maintainability and reduces bundle size.
- The Memory Bank has been updated to accurately reflect the current state of the project.
- It's crucial to thoroughly verify dependency usage, as simple file searches might miss indirect or framework-level usages.
- User feedback is paramount in determining necessary dependencies, especially for those not directly imported but used by the framework or other components.
