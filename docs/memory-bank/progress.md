# Progress: TemperatureChart

## 1. What Works

- **Project Scaffolding**: The Next.js project is set up with the necessary file structure and dependencies.
- **UI Components**: Essential UI components from Shadcn/UI are available and integrated.
- **Core Logic (Inferred)**: The foundational logic for fetching weather data and displaying the chart is likely in place or partially implemented.
- **Codebase Cleanliness**: Unused AI features, UI components, and hooks have been successfully removed, and related import errors have been resolved.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Unnecessary dependencies have been identified and removed, streamlining the project. `next-themes` and `lucide-react` were re-added as they are in use. `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod` were also re-added by the user, indicating their necessity.
- **API Enhancement**: The weather API call now includes sunrise and sunset data.
- **Chart Visualization**: The temperature chart now visually distinguishes between day and night hours.
- **CI/CD Setup**: GitHub Actions workflow for running tests has been created and configured.
- **Test Dependency Fix**: `ts-node` has been added and installed to resolve CI test failures.
- **Hourly Variable Integration**: The REST API for Open-Meteo now includes Relative Humidity, Apparent Temperature, Precipitation Probability, and Weather Code. These data points are displayed on the tooltip with improved aesthetics, including icons and bolded key-value pairs. The `getWeatherDescription` helper function has been refactored to use consistent function definitions.
- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion with `localStorage` persistence.
- **Time Format Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for AM/PM and military time format with `localStorage` persistence.
- **Responsive Header Layout**: The header is now fully responsive, with toggle buttons positioned inline with the main title on larger screens for a cleaner UI. The breakpoint for rearrangement has been adjusted to `lg` for better tablet responsiveness.
- **Responsive Text Sizes**: Implemented responsive text size adjustments across `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`, and `src/components/metadata.tsx` to ensure optimal readability on mobile devices while maintaining aesthetics on larger screens.
- **Daily Overview Layout**: Adjusted the `Metadata` component (`src/components/metadata.tsx`) to display daily overview items in a 2-column grid on mobile, improving layout and readability.
- **Type and Test Issues Fixed**: All type errors and test failures in `src/lib/weather.test.ts` have been resolved by updating `getWeatherDataByZip` calls with the `date` argument and correcting the mock API URL assertion.
- **Missing Dependency Type Errors Fixed**: Installed `react-day-picker` and `@radix-ui/react-popover` to resolve "Cannot find module" and "implicitly has an 'any' type" errors in `src/components/ui/calendar.tsx` and `src/components/ui/popover.tsx`.
- **Current Hour Highlighting**: The bar corresponding to the current hour is highlighted, but now only when the selected day is the current day.
- **Weather Icons and Color Coding**: Implemented a comprehensive system for displaying weather icons at the base of the chart bars, with specific icons and color variations for all WMO weather codes, including distinctions for day/night and precipitation intensity (light, moderate, heavy). This involved adding `CloudHail` and refining the `getWeatherIcon` function in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Complete UI Implementation**: The main page needs to be fully assembled using the available components. (This is largely done, but keeping it here as a general placeholder for any remaining minor UI assembly).
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user notifications need to be implemented.
- **Styling and Animations**: The final styling and animations need to be applied according to the guidelines.

## 3. Current Status

The project has undergone significant cleanup and core functionality enhancements. The foundational structure is robust, and the codebase is streamlined. The temperature chart now provides a richer visual experience with day/night indicators and enhanced tooltips. Automated testing has been set up in CI, and all tests are now passing. The application now supports both Fahrenheit/Celsius and AM/PM/Military time format toggles with persistence. All type-checking errors have been resolved. All WMO weather codes are now covered with appropriate icons and color coding for intensity.

## 4. Known Issues

- None.

## 5. Completed Tasks

- **Fixed Failing Tests**:
  - Removed the hour display from the tooltip content in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`.
  - Updated `src/components/temperature-chart.test.tsx` to no longer assert the presence of the hour in the tooltip.
- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion with `localStorage` persistence.
  - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Modified `getWeatherDataByZip` to always fetch data in Celsius.
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Added `celsiusData` state to store original Celsius data, and a `useEffect` hook to convert to Fahrenheit when the unit is toggled.
  - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Updated to accept `unit` prop and dynamically update chart labels and tooltips.
  - **UI Refinement**: Modified the temperature unit toggle button in `src/app/page.tsx` to be smaller, use "°C" / "°F" symbols, and be positioned next to the theme toggle.
- **Day/Night Chart Visualization**: Implemented visual distinction for day and night in the temperature chart.
  - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Updated `getWeatherDataByZip` to fetch `daily=sunrise,sunset` data.
  - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Modified to use `sunrise` and `sunset` props to determine day/night and adjust bar `fill` color accordingly (dim for night, bright for day, accent for current hour).
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Updated to pass `sunrise` and `sunset` data from the API response to the `TemperatureChart` component.
- **Footer Implementation**: Added a footer component with a link to the GitHub repository and author acknowledgment, including the current year.
  - `src/components/footer.tsx`: Created a new component for the footer and added the current year.
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Integrated the `Footer` component into the main page.
- **Metadata Component**: Added a new component to display daily weather metadata.
  - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Modified `getWeatherDataByZip` to fetch `temperature_2m_max`, `temperature_2m_min`, `precipitation_probability_max`, and `daylight_duration`.
  - `src/components/metadata.tsx`: Created a new component to display these daily metadata points.
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Integrated the `Metadata` component between the zip code input and the temperature chart, passing the new data.
  - **Dependency Added**: Installed `date-fns` for date and time formatting.
- **CI/CD Setup**: Configured GitHub Actions to run tests automatically.
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Created the workflow file.
  - `package.json`: Added `ts-node` to `devDependencies` and ran `npm install` to fix CI test failures.
- **Hourly Variable Integration**:
  - Modified `src/lib/weather.ts` to include `relative_humidity_2m`, `apparent_temperature`, `precipitation_probability`, and `weather_code` in the Open-Meteo API request and updated the `ForecastData` interface.
  - Updated `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` to display these new data points in the chart's tooltip, including a `getWeatherDescription` helper function.
  - Refactored `getWeatherDescription` to use `function functionName() {}` syntax.
  - Enhanced tooltip aesthetics in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` with `lucide-react` icons, improved layout, and bolded key-value pairs.
- **Test Fixes (Complete)**:
  - Updated `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to remove the `unit` parameter from `getWeatherDataByZip` calls, update the `fetchMock` assertion to expect `celsius`, and remove the redundant test case.
- **Time Format Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for AM/PM and military time format with `localStorage` persistence.
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Added `timeFormat` state with `localStorage` integration, a UI toggle button, and passed the `timeFormat` to `TemperatureChart`.
  - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Updated to accept `timeFormat` prop and format chart x-axis labels accordingly using a new `formatTime` helper function.
- **Responsive Header Layout**: Updated the header in `src/app/page.tsx` to be more responsive, with toggle buttons positioned inline with the main title on larger screens. The breakpoint for rearrangement has been adjusted to `lg`.
- **Responsive Text Sizes**: Implemented responsive text size adjustments across `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`, and `src/components/metadata.tsx` to ensure optimal readability on mobile devices while maintaining aesthetics on larger screens.
- **Date Selection Feature**: Added a "Change Day" button with a calendar dropdown to allow users to select a specific date for the weather forecast. The `getWeatherDataByZip` function was updated to accept and use this date for API calls.
- **Bug Fix**: Corrected the geocoding API URL in `src/lib/weather.ts` from `api.zippopot.us` to `api.zippopotam.us` to resolve `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors.
- **Bug Fix**: Removed `forecast_days=1` parameter from Open-Meteo API call in `src/lib/weather.ts` to resolve conflict with `start_date` and `end_date` parameters.
- **Type and Test Issues Fixed**:
  - Updated `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to pass the `date` argument to `getWeatherDataByZip` in all test calls.
  - Corrected the mocked Open-Meteo API URL assertion in `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to use `start_date` and `end_date` parameters instead of `forecast_days=1`.
- **Missing Dependency Type Errors Fixed**:
  - Installed `react-day-picker` and `@radix-ui/react-popover` to resolve "Cannot find module" and "implicitly has an 'any' type" errors.
- **Mobile Layout Adjustment**: Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to adjust the layout for mobile devices, ensuring the date picker appears below the zip code input and submit button, while the latter two remain on the same row.
- **Geolocation Feature**: Implemented a geolocation button in `src/app/page.tsx` that uses the browser's `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` API to fetch latitude and longitude.
  - When geolocation is used, the stored zip code in `localStorage` is cleared, and the fetched coordinates are saved.
  - Refactored `src/lib/weather.ts` to include a new `getWeatherDataByCoords` function and modified `handleFetchWeather` in `src/app/page.tsx` to use either zip code or coordinates for fetching weather data.
  - Added tests for `getWeatherDataByCoords` in `src/lib/weather.test.ts`.
- **Input Field Layout Fix**: Adjusted the layout of the input fields and buttons in `src/app/page.tsx` to ensure the calendar selector is always below the zip code input and "Get Weather" button, providing more space for the zip code input.
- **Location Display Logic**: Modified `src/lib/weather.ts` to display the actual location name (city, state) when using a zip code, and latitude/longitude when using the geolocation feature. Updated `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to reflect this change in expected output.
- **Weather Icons and Color Coding**: Implemented a comprehensive system for displaying weather icons at the base of the chart bars, with specific icons and color variations for all WMO weather codes, including distinctions for day/night and precipitation intensity (light, moderate, heavy). This involved adding `CloudHail` and refining the `getWeatherIcon` function in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`.
