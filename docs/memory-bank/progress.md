# Progress: TemperatureChart

## 1. What Works

- **Project Scaffolding**: The Next.js project is set up with the necessary file structure and dependencies.
- **UI Components**: Essential UI components from Shadcn/UI are available and integrated.
- **Core Logic (Inferred)**: The foundational logic for fetching weather data and displaying the chart is likely in place or partially implemented.
- **Codebase Cleanliness**: Unused AI features, UI components, and hooks have been successfully removed, and related import errors have been resolved.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Unnecessary dependencies have been identified and removed, streamlining the project. `next-themes` and `lucide-react` were re-added as they are in use. `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod` were also re-added by the user, indicating their necessity.
- **API Enhancement**: The weather API call now includes sunrise and sunset data.
- **Chart Visualization**: The temperature chart now visually distinguishes between day and night hours.
- **CI/CD Setup**: GitHub Actions workflow for running tests has been created and configured.
- **Test Dependency Fix**: `ts-node` has been added and installed to resolve CI test failures.
- **Hourly Variable Integration**: The REST API for Open-Meteo now includes Relative Humidity, Apparent Temperature, Precipitation Probability, and Weather Code. These data points are displayed on the tooltip with improved aesthetics, including icons and bolded key-value pairs. The `getWeatherDescription` helper function has been refactored to use consistent function definitions.
- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion with `localStorage` persistence.
- **Time Format Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for AM/PM and military time format with `localStorage` persistence.
- **Responsive Header Layout**: The header is now fully responsive, with toggle buttons positioned inline with the main title on larger screens for a cleaner UI. The breakpoint for rearrangement has been adjusted to `lg` for better tablet responsiveness.
- **Responsive Text Sizes**: Implemented responsive text size adjustments across `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`, and `src/components/metadata.tsx` to ensure optimal readability on mobile devices while maintaining aesthetics on larger screens.
- **Daily Overview Layout**: Adjusted the `Metadata` component (`src/components/metadata.tsx`) to display daily overview items in a 2-column grid on mobile, improving layout and readability.
- **Type and Test Issues Fixed**: All type errors and test failures in `src/lib/weather.test.ts` have been resolved by updating `getWeatherDataByZip` calls with the `date` argument and correcting the mock API URL assertion.
- **Missing Dependency Type Errors Fixed**: Installed `react-day-picker` and `@radix-ui/react-popover` to resolve "Cannot find module" and "implicitly has an 'any' type" errors in `src/components/ui/calendar.tsx` and `src/components/ui/popover.tsx`.
- **Current Hour Highlighting**: The bar corresponding to the current hour is highlighted, but now only when the selected day is the current day.
- **Weather Icons and Color Coding**: Implemented a comprehensive system for displaying weather icons at the base of the chart bars, with specific icons and color variations for all WMO weather codes, including distinctions for day/night and precipitation intensity (light, moderate, heavy). This involved adding `CloudHail` and refining the `getWeatherIcon` function in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`.
- **Hourly Variable Selection Feature**: The feature to select different hourly variables for the chart is implemented. This includes:
  - A new `VariableSelector` component (`src/components/variable-selector.tsx`) with a dropdown, card, and radio buttons.
  - Integration into `src/app/page.tsx` with state management for the selected variable.
  - Dynamic chart updates in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` based on the selected variable (Y-axis data key, label, and chart title).
  - Consistent data structures (`Forecast` and `ChartDataItem` interfaces) across `src/lib/weather.ts` and `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`.
  - The `VariableSelector` dropdown button displays the selected variable's name with a corresponding Lucide icon and is left-aligned.
  - The `VariableSelector` is positioned below the calendar selector and matches its width.
- **API Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for Open-Meteo and Zippopotam.us API calls.
  - Defined custom `RateLimitError` and `GenericApiError` classes in `src/lib/weather.ts`.
  - Modified `getWeatherDataByCoords` to throw `RateLimitError` for 400 status codes with "limit exceeded" reason from Open-Meteo, and `GenericApiError` for other Open-Meteo API errors.
  - Modified `getWeatherDataByZip` to throw `Error` for 404 status codes (zip code not found) and `GenericApiError` for other `zippopotam.us` API errors (as `zippopotam.us` has no rate limits).
  - Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to catch these specific error types and conditionally render `RateLimitCard` or `GenericErrorCard` components, providing clear user feedback.
- **HTTP Request Caching**: Implemented caching for weather data API calls using `lru-cache` with a 30-minute TTL. Cache keys are generated based on a combination of location data (latitude/longitude or zip code) and the selected date, ensuring unique and type-specific cache hits. The `src/lib/cache.ts` file was created and configured for this purpose, and `src/lib/weather.ts` was updated to integrate the caching logic. Tests in `src/lib/weather.test.ts` were also updated to verify the caching behavior.
- **Zip Code Input Layout**: The zip code input box in `src/app/page.tsx` has been adjusted to be exactly half the width of its row, by wrapping it and the associated buttons in separate `w-1/2` divs within the flex container.
- **Date and Variable Selector Layout**: The date selector and variable selector in `src/app/page.tsx` are now on the same row, each occupying half the width, by wrapping them in a new flex container. The `VariableSelector` component (`src/components/variable-selector.tsx`) was updated to accept a `className` prop to facilitate this layout change.

  - Updated `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` to display these new data points in the chart's tooltip, including a `getWeatherDescription` helper function.
  - Refactored `getWeatherDescription` to use `function functionName() {}` syntax.
  - Enhanced tooltip aesthetics in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx` with `lucide-react` icons, improved layout, and bolded key-value pairs.
- **Test Fixes (Complete)**:
  - Updated `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to remove the `unit` parameter from `getWeatherDataByZip` calls, update the `fetchMock` assertion to expect `celsius`, and remove the redundant test case.
- **Time Format Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for AM/PM and military time format with `localStorage` persistence.
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Added `timeFormat` state with `localStorage` integration, a UI toggle button, and passed the `timeFormat` to `TemperatureChart`.
  - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Updated to accept `timeFormat` prop and format chart x-axis labels accordingly using a new `formatTime` helper function.
- **Responsive Header Layout**: Updated the header in `src/app/page.tsx` to be more responsive, with toggle buttons positioned inline with the main title on larger screens. The breakpoint for rearrangement has been adjusted to `lg`.
- **Responsive Text Sizes**: Implemented responsive text size adjustments across `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`, and `src/components/metadata.tsx` to ensure optimal readability on mobile devices while maintaining aesthetics on larger screens.
- **Date Selection Feature**: Added a "Change Day" button with a calendar dropdown to allow users to select a specific date for the weather forecast. The `getWeatherDataByZip` function was updated to accept and use this date for API calls.
- **Bug Fix**: Corrected the geocoding API URL in `src/lib/weather.ts` from `api.zippopot.us` to `api.zippopotam.us` to resolve `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors.
- **Bug Fix**: Removed `forecast_days=1` parameter from Open-Meteo API call in `src/lib/weather.ts` to resolve conflict with `start_date` and `end_date` parameters.
- **Type and Test Issues Fixed**:
  - Updated `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to pass the `date` argument to `getWeatherDataByZip` in all test calls.
  - Corrected the mocked Open-Meteo API URL assertion in `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to use `start_date` and `end_date` parameters instead of `forecast_days=1`.
- **Mobile Layout Adjustment**: Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to adjust the layout for mobile devices, ensuring the date picker appears below the zip code input and submit button, while the latter two remain on the same row.
- **Geolocation Feature**: Implemented a geolocation button in `src/app/page.tsx` that uses the browser's `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` API to fetch latitude and longitude.
  - When geolocation is used, the stored zip code in `localStorage` is cleared, and the fetched coordinates are saved.
  - Refactored `src/lib/weather.ts` to include a new `getWeatherDataByCoords` function and modified `handleFetchWeather` in `src/app/page.tsx` to use either zip code or coordinates for fetching weather data.
  - Added tests for `getWeatherDataByCoords` in `src/lib/weather.test.ts`.
- **Input Field Layout Fix**: Adjusted the layout of the input fields and buttons in `src/app/page.tsx` to ensure the calendar selector is always below the zip code input and "Get Weather" button, providing more space for the zip code input.
- **Location Display Logic**: Modified `src/lib/weather.ts` to display the actual location name (city, state) when using a zip code, and latitude/longitude when using the geolocation feature. Updated `src/lib/weather.test.ts` to reflect this change in expected output.
- **Weather Icons and Color Coding**: Implemented a comprehensive system for displaying weather icons at the base of the chart bars, with specific icons and color variations for all WMO weather codes, including distinctions for day/night and precipitation intensity (light, moderate, heavy). This involved adding `CloudHail` and refining the `getWeatherIcon` function in `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`.
- **API Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for Open-Meteo and Zippopotam.us API calls.
  - Defined custom `RateLimitError` and `GenericApiError` classes in `src/lib/weather.ts`.
  - Modified `getWeatherDataByCoords` and `getWeatherDataByZip` to throw these custom errors based on HTTP status codes (429 for rate limit, others for generic API failures).
  - Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to catch these specific error types and conditionally render `RateLimitCard` or `GenericErrorCard` components, providing clear user feedback.
- **HTTP Request Caching**: Implemented caching for weather data API calls using `lru-cache` with a 30-minute TTL. Cache keys are generated based on a combination of location data (latitude/longitude or zip code) and the selected date, ensuring unique and type-specific cache hits. The `src/lib/cache.ts` file was created and configured for this purpose, and `src/lib/weather.ts` was updated to integrate the caching logic. Tests in `src/lib/weather.test.ts` were also updated to verify the caching behavior.
