# Progress: TemperatureChart

## 1. What Works

- **Project Scaffolding**: The Next.js project is set up with the necessary file structure and dependencies.
- **UI Components**: A library of UI components is available through Shadcn/UI.
- **Core Logic (Inferred)**: Based on the file structure, the foundational logic for fetching weather data and displaying the chart is likely in place or partially implemented.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Complete UI Implementation**: The main page needs to be fully assembled using the available components.
- **API Integration**: The connection to the Open Meteo API needs to be implemented and tested.
- **Data Handling**: The logic for processing the API response and passing it to the chart component needs to be finalized.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user notifications need to be implemented.
- **Styling and Animations**: The final styling and animations need to be applied according to the guidelines.

## 3. Current Status

The project is in the early stages of development. The foundational structure is in place, but the core functionality is not yet fully implemented. The immediate next step is to begin building out the UI and integrating the weather API.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.
