# Progress: TemperatureChart

## 1. What Works

- **Project Scaffolding**: The Next.js project is set up with the necessary file structure and dependencies.
- **UI Components**: Essential UI components from Shadcn/UI are available and integrated.
- **Core Logic (Inferred)**: The foundational logic for fetching weather data and displaying the chart is likely in place or partially implemented.
- **Codebase Cleanliness**: Unused AI features, UI components, and hooks have been successfully removed, and related import errors have been resolved.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Unnecessary dependencies have been identified and removed, streamlining the project. `next-themes` and `lucide-react` were re-added as they are in use. `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod` were also re-added by the user, indicating their necessity.
- **API Enhancement**: The weather API call now includes sunrise and sunset data.
- **Chart Visualization**: The temperature chart now visually distinguishes between day and night hours.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Complete UI Implementation**: The main page needs to be fully assembled using the available components. (This is largely done, but keeping it here as a general placeholder for any remaining minor UI assembly).
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user notifications need to be implemented.
- **Styling and Animations**: The final styling and animations need to be applied according to the guidelines.

## 3. Current Status

The project has undergone significant cleanup and core functionality enhancements. The foundational structure is robust, and the codebase is streamlined. The temperature chart now provides a richer visual experience with day/night indicators. The immediate next steps involve refining error handling and ensuring all styling and animations are complete.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.

## 5. Completed Tasks

- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion with `localStorage` persistence.
    - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Modified `getWeatherDataByZip` to accept a `unit` parameter for API calls.
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Added `unit` state with `localStorage` integration, a UI toggle button, and updated `handleFetchWeather` to pass the selected unit.
    - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Updated to accept `unit` prop and dynamically update chart labels and tooltips. Removed redundant client-side F/C conversion as the API now provides the correct unit.
    - **UI Refinement**: Modified the temperature unit toggle button in `src/app/page.tsx` to be smaller, use "°C" / "°F" symbols, and be positioned next to the theme toggle.
- **Day/Night Chart Visualization**: Implemented visual distinction for day and night in the temperature chart.
    - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Updated `getWeatherDataByZip` to fetch `daily=sunrise,sunset` data.
    - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Modified to use `sunrise` and `sunset` props to determine day/night and adjust bar `fill` color accordingly (dim for night, bright for day, accent for current hour).
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Updated to pass `sunrise` and `sunset` data from the API response to the `TemperatureChart` component.
- **Footer Implementation**: Added a footer component with a link to the GitHub repository and author acknowledgment, including the current year.
    - `src/components/footer.tsx`: Created a new component for the footer and added the current year.
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Integrated the `Footer` component into the main page.
- **Metadata Component**: Added a new component to display daily weather metadata.
    - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Modified `getWeatherDataByZip` to fetch `temperature_2m_max`, `temperature_2m_min`, `precipitation_probability_max`, and `daylight_duration`.
    - `src/components/metadata.tsx`: Created a new component to display these daily metadata points.
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Integrated the `Metadata` component between the zip code input and the temperature chart, passing the new data.
    - **Dependency Added**: Installed `date-fns` for date and time formatting.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.
