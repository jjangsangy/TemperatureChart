# Progress: TemperatureChart

## 1. What Works

- **Project Scaffolding**: The Next.js project is set up with the necessary file structure and dependencies.
- **UI Components**: Essential UI components from Shadcn/UI are available and integrated.
- **Core Logic (Inferred)**: The foundational logic for fetching weather data and displaying the chart is likely in place or partially implemented.
- **Codebase Cleanliness**: Unused AI features, UI components, and hooks have been successfully removed, and related import errors have been resolved.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Unnecessary dependencies have been identified and removed, streamlining the project. `next-themes` and `lucide-react` were re-added as they are in use. `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `recharts`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod` were also re-added by the user, indicating their necessity.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Complete UI Implementation**: The main page needs to be fully assembled using the available components.
- **API Integration**: The connection to the Open Meteo API needs to be implemented and tested.
- **Data Handling**: The logic for processing the API response and passing it to the chart component needs to be finalized.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user notifications need to be implemented.
- **Styling and Animations**: The final styling and animations need to be applied according to the guidelines.

## 3. Current Status

The project has undergone a significant cleanup, removing unnecessary code and dependencies. The foundational structure is in place, and the codebase is now streamlined. The core functionality is not yet fully implemented, but the path forward is clearer. The immediate next step is to begin building out the UI and integrating the weather API.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.

## 5. Completed Tasks

- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Implemented a toggle for Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion with `localStorage` persistence.
    - `src/lib/weather.ts`: Modified `getWeatherDataByZip` to accept a `unit` parameter for API calls.
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Added `unit` state with `localStorage` integration, a UI toggle button, and updated `handleFetchWeather` to pass the selected unit.
    - `src/components/temperature-chart.tsx`: Updated to accept `unit` prop and dynamically update chart labels and tooltips. Removed redundant client-side F/C conversion as the API now provides the correct unit.
    - **UI Refinement**: Modified the temperature unit toggle button in `src/app/page.tsx` to be smaller, use "°C" / "°F" symbols, and be positioned next to the theme toggle.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.
